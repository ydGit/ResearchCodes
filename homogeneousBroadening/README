The MATLAB *.m files were written with the goal to create a user-friendly Graphical Interface to the calculations 
a model from the paper
V. Hizhynakov J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. 20 (1987) 6073 - 6087

It describes the interaction of a two-level system placed within a crystal with a lattice vibrations. 
GUIExample.png demonstrates the final result.

Python files provide basically the same functionality and were written earlier, when the speed of the 
numerical calculations was not an issue.
