These Wolfram Mathematica codes were used to calculate the effects of orientations of dipoles in 
crystals when excited with Gaussian laser beams and signal detected at various angles. The 
effect of using a microscope with finine numerical aperture is explored. Also, the difference in
the polarization dependece of the collected signal is calculated for both electric and magnetic 
dipoles.
