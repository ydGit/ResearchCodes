This Octave/Matlab script evaluates the dispersion curve for the optical plasmons propagating in the 
topological insulator surface. The topological insulator is surrounded by two dielectric 
media with dielectric constants epsilonT and epsilonB. The calculations are based on the 
formula given in the paper T. Stauber and G. Gomez-Santos and L. Brey "Spin-charge 
separation of plasmonic excitations in thin film topological insulators" Physical Review B 88, 205427 (2013)
