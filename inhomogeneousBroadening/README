This set of programs is used to calculate the effects of so called inhomogeneous broadening -- increase of the 
observed linewidth in the photo-luminescence spectra when collecting the signal from a large number of 
emitters.

C-files contain the calculations in the linear approximation, when the spectral shift is linearly proportional 
to the perturbation. 

Python code MCMCTEST.PY and MCMCTEST3.PY implements Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method for calculating 
the spectral shift using the approximation of Nearest Neighbor, when only one or two "perturbing defects" land 
near the emitter.

EXPERIMENTAL.PY is a python code used to lauch several jobs on a system with multiple CPU's.

Text files PARAMETERS.TXT provides examples of the parameters that can be fed to BROADLIN family of programs.
